# Reading Manager

## Motivation

This is a simple manager for the personal reading progress, especially for books.

DouBan only provides the way to mark the book you are reading or have read, 
but have no way to take care where you have been reading at present.
I have **always** been forgeting the books I am reading, as so many stuffs disturbing.
This is why I launch this program.


## TODO

## Usage

Add `readmanager` to `PATH`
